# McDonald_spil.
    This is a game, developed by Emilie, Eline and Christina. This game has no actual usage other than having fun and wanting to play like an Alien finding money to buy McDonalds food. That can also be fun. It's not an open source code, because otherwise everyone would be able to steal our game - which we won't like. But we do want our buyers to comment on what is good and what can be better.

# Before you start, you need to open your commandoprompt or terminal (depending on which control system you're working on) and type in the following to be able to programe and run the game. You must already have Python installed on your computer, since it runs by that.
